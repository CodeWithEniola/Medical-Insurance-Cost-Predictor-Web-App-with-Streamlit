# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Predictor-Web-App-with-Streamlit

This project involves building a predictive model to estimate medical insurance costs based on various features. The model is developed using Python and deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict the costs associated with medical insurance using a regression model. The model takes various inputs related to the patient's demographic and health characteristics and predicts the total medical insurance cost.

**Technologies Used**
1. Python: Programming language used for data processing and model development.
2. pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
3. NumPy: Library for numerical computations.
4. scikit-learn: Library for machine learning.
5. Streamlit: Framework for building web applications.
6. Pickle: Python module for serializing and de-serializing Python objects.

**Data Description**
The dataset used for training the model contains various features, including:

1. Age
2. Sex
3. BMI (Body Mass Index)
4. Number of children
5. Smoker status
6. Region
7. Medical insurance costs
   
The data is sourced from public datasets that provide information on health insurance claims, and check the insurance.csv file

**Running the Application**
Run the Streamlit App: Open a terminal in your project directory and execute:
streamlit run app.py

Access the App:
A new tab will open in your web browser, displaying the insurance cost prediction application.

**Usage**
Enter the required inputs in the provided fields and click on the Predict button to obtain the estimated medical insurance cost.
